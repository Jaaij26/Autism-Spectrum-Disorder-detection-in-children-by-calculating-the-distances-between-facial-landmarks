1. Classified a child as autistic or non-autistic using algortihms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN, and Decision Tree.
2. Utilized Mediapipe framework for extracting facial features.
3. Obtained an accuracy of 83.5% using 'GridSearchCV' and 'Hyper-Parameter Tuning'.
   
Conference paper titled ‘Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection in Children by Calculating the Distances between Facial Landmarks’ was presented at the '14th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)-2023', held at IIT Delhi, India, and published in IEEE Xplore.
